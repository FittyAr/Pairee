### Changed
- The log file `app.log` is appended to instead of truncated on every start, and rotates to `app.log.1` past 5 MiB; two Pairee windows no longer overwrite each other's log.
- Release builds log at `info` level instead of `debug` (`RUST_LOG=debug` restores the detail); errors while loading the configuration or running a subcommand are now logged too.
